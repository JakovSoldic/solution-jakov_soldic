Integration tests: ProductRepositoryIT

## Architecture
Project uses Package by Feature structure.

## AI Tools Used
This project was developed with the assistance of Claude (Anthropic).

### Where and Why
- **Project architecture** - Used Claude to decide on project structure 
  (Package by Feature) and select appropriate Spring Boot dependencies
- **JWT Authentication** - Used Claude to help implement Spring Security OAuth2
- **JPA/Specifications** - Used Claude to implement JpaSpecificationExecutor 
  for dynamic product filtering
- **Unit & Integration Tests** - Used Claude to understand testing concepts 
  (MockitoExtension, @DataJpaTest)
- **Debugging** - Used Claude to resolve errors during development
